 — 
Israel and Hamas continued to negotiate through mediators Friday over the potential release of hostages from Gaza that would prompt another pause in hostilities, sources said, despite the ending of the week-long truce and the resumption of fighting.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said earlier it had “resumed combat operations” and accused Hamas of violating the truce first by firing rockets toward Israeli territory.

A total of 178 people have been killed, with hundreds more wounded, since military operations restarted early Friday, according to a spokesman from Gaza’s Hamas-run Ministry of Health.

But efforts to revive the truce continued, with Israel and Hamas – in consultation with Qatar, the United States and Egypt – actively discussing the release of the rest of the women hostages, according to a source familiar with the discussions.

The IDF said Friday that there are 136 hostages still being held hostage in Gaza, including 17 women and children.

If the remaining civilian women were to be successfully released, the parameters of the negotiations would quickly turn to the release of civilian men as well as both male and female military reservists, two sources said. The negotiating parties believe securing the release of Israeli soldiers will be the most difficult.

The Biden administration and Israeli officials believe that Hamas continues to hold a number of women aged approximately between 20 and 30 – many of them kidnapped from the Nova music festival, one US official and another source familiar with the matter tell CNN.

The young women still held by Hamas are of particular concern to Israel. In hostage negotiations with Israel on Thursday and in the hours after fighting resumed, Hamas has been insisting that that they did not have any more non-military female hostages to release, claiming that some of the remaining women in their captivity were considered a part of the Israel Defense Forces, the sources said.

The resumption of fighting early Friday morning marked the end of a brittle truce between the warring parties that allowed for the release of 110 Israeli women and children, as well as foreign nationals, who had been taken hostage by Hamas during its October 7 attack, and for the release of about 240 Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails.

Within minutes of the truce expiring, smoke could be seen billowing across parts of the densely populated enclave as the IDF declared it was once again “out to destroy” Hamas. Early Friday evening, Israel’s Iron Dome defense system intercepted incoming rockets near Tel Aviv, CNN staff saw.

The Israel-Hamas truce is over. Here’s what could happen next
Netanyahu’s office said Hamas “didn’t respect its obligation to release today all the abducted women and launched rockets towards the citizens of Israel.”

Netanyahu said his government remained committed to achieving its war aims, which he said were releasing the hostages, eliminating Hamas and ensuring that Gaza never again constitutes a threat to Israelis.

The Hamas-controlled Government Media Office in Gaza blamed the international community – and the United States in particular – for the resumption of fighting, saying they bear “responsibility for the crimes of the ‘Israeli’ occupation and the continuation of the brutal war against civilians, children and women in the Gaza Strip.”


With the resumption of fighting came an expansion of Israel’s military operations in Gaza, which have until now been concentrated in the north. The IDF dropped leaflets in the southern city of Khan Younis on Friday, calling it a “fighting zone” and telling residents to “evacuate immediately.”

Israel repeatedly told residents of northern Gaza to move south of Wadi Gaza – the wetlands that roughly split the territory – for their safety. Khan Younis is located south of that line.

Before the truce began last week, Israel defense minister Yoav Gallant had warned Israel will aim to “dismantle Hamas wherever it is,” which “will include both the north and the south” of Gaza.

The IDF released a new map Friday showing Gaza divided into hundreds of numbered districts showing “evacuation zones” to be used in the “next stage of the war.” It said the map “enables the residents of Gaza to orient themselves and to evacuate from specific places for their safety if required.”

Later Friday, the IDF confirmed it was conducting offensive operations in southern parts of the territory, including Khan Younis and Rafah.

In a video statement, Israel war cabinet member and former Defense Minister Benny Gantz said Israel had “prepared for widening the framework” of its operation in order to bring the remaining hostages home.
